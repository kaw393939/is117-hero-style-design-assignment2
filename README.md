## üé® Hero Section Design Principles

A hero section is the first thing visitors see on your website. It must immediately communicate who you are, what you offer, and why it matters. Here's how to create an effective hero section:

### **Essential Elements**
1. **Compelling Headline**: Clearly states your value proposition
2. **Supporting Subtext**: Provides additional context or benefits
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Guides the eye through your content
4. **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: Tells users what to do next
5. **Visual Element**: Image, video, or graphic that supports your message

### **Layout Strategies**
- **Centered Layout**: Focus on message, minimal distractions
- **Split Layout**: Text on one side, visual on the other
- **Background Hero**: Large background image with overlaid text
- **Video Hero**: Engaging video background with text overlay

### **Typography Guidelines**
- **Headline**: 2.5-4rem font size, bold weight, primary brand font
- **Subtext**: 1.1-1.3rem font size, lighter weight, easy to read
- **Hierarchy**: Clear size differences between headline, subtext, and CTA
- **Contrast**: Ensure text is readable against background
