## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### **Strategy Tips**
- **Start with your audience, not your preferences** - Choose archetype based on what your users need emotionally
- **Be specific with your value proposition** - "We help busy parents save time" vs "We provide convenience"
- **Study real examples** - Look at 3-5 professional websites in your chosen archetype
- **Keep it simple** - One clear message is better than multiple confusing ones

### **Design Tips**
- **Mobile-first approach** - Design for small screens first, then scale up
- **Contrast is king** - Ensure text is readable against backgrounds (4.5:1 minimum ratio)
- **White space matters** - Give your content room to breathe
- **Test on real devices** - Don't just rely on browser developer tools

### **Technical Tips**
- **Use semantic HTML** - Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.) helps screen readers
- **CSS custom properties** - Define colors and fonts as variables for easy maintenance
- **Optimize images** - Compress images and use appropriate formats
- **Validate your code** - Use HTML/CSS validators to catch errors

### **AI Assistance Tips**
- **Be specific** - "Add 20px margin-top to the headline" vs "add some space"
- **Provide context** - "For mobile screens under 768px" when asking for responsive changes
- **Iterate gradually** - Make small changes and test, rather than big overhauls
- **Learn from suggestions** - Understand why the AI recommends certain approaches
